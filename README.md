Notes to self
-------------

The following is more of a note to myself.


Composer
--------

I use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

The following requires you to have composer.phar installed and in your $PATH.
There must also already be a composer.json file in your project directory.

On your command line do this to install your project:

cd /path/to/project

composer install

On your command line do this to update your project:

cd /path/to/project

composer update

RedBeanPHP
----------

I enjoy [RedBeanPHP](http://redbeanphp.com/) as a ORM.

On your command line do this to build a rbnc.php file:

php nocomment.php

This will give you a rbnc.php file which combines all that was in your replica.xml satisfying your flavor.


Tests
-----

I use [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/).

On your command line do this to run a test:

cd /path/to/project/tests

../vendor/bin/phpunit StackTest.php
