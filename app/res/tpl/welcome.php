            <h1>Hi Screenreaders!</h1>
        </header>
        <p>If you do not see a picture for any reason, i want to tell you that at the point of this writing i was unable to forsee which image this page will display and could therefor not describe it now.</p>
        <p>Hopefully the person that later puts the image up will give a good description in the alt tag of any given image.</p>
        <p>Please e-mail to <a href="info@sah-company.com">info@sah-company.com</a> if you have the feeling that your screenreader did not provide a fitting description of this page image.</p>
